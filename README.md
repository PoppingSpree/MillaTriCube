### GENERAL INFORMATION:

- A mod for Freedom Planet 2. Makes Milla default to spawning 6 cubes at a time instead of just one. You can change the number of cubes you want in the config file at `<FP2 Install Dir>/UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg` If you don't see the file, you need to launch the game with the mod installed once, then close it and check for the file again. 
- Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader).

### HOW TO INSTALL:

1: Get Melon Loader https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases

2: Get MillaTriCube.dll https://github.com/PoppingSpree/FP2Trainer/releases/tag/MillaTriCube v1.0

3: Install Melon Loader into your copy of FP2. (You may want to copy your game folder and mod the copy instead because updates are coming fast right now and mods will break.)

4: Add the MillaTriCube.dll to your Mods folder in your modded copy of the game. (If the Mods folder didn't appear when you installed Melon Loader, try running the game again, close it, and then check if the folder has been generated.)

5: Launch the game. Play any level as Milla. Any time you press the Special button, you'll have more cubes! Good luck, and enjoy the green jello!
